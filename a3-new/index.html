            <h4>Brief Description</h4>
            <p>World War II, spanning from 1939 to 1945, was a seismic global conflict triggered by Nazi Germany's
                invasion of Poland. Rooted in the aftermath of World War I, economic hardships, and the rise of fascist
                regimes, the war saw pivotal moments like Germany's lightning-fast conquests across Europe, the heroic
                defense in the Battle of Britain, and the United States' entry after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941.<br><br>

                As the war raged on, Allied forces mounted a massive amphibious assault on Normandy on D-Day in 1944,
                which marked a turning point in the conflict. The relentless Soviet advance from the east also played a
                crucial role in defeating Nazi Germany. The war's devastating toll culminated in the unconditional
                surrender of both Germany and Japan in 1945.<br><br>

                World War II reshaped the global landscape, leading to the establishment of the United Nations and
                profound social, political, and economic changes, while leaving an indelible mark on the collective
                memory of humanity as one of the deadliest conflicts in history.
